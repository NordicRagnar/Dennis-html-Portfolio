<h1>About Me</h1>


  <p>Hey, my name is Dennis Rimkus. I’m excited to share my first HTML project with you.<br/>
  I was a soldier in the German Army for 12 years. After that, I decided to earn a mechanic certification.<br/>
  I worked hard and obtained a motorcycle mechanic certification, which is known as a "Gesellenbrief" in Germany.<br/>
  However, my life didn’t feel healthy or fulfilling, so I decided to go to university and become a software engineer.<br/>
  In June 2024, I started studying and earning certifications on Udemy. My biggest dream is to work as a software engineer.</p>
  
  <p>On this website, you will see two of my first projects from the Udemy course "Fullstack Web Developer".<br/>
  I hope you enjoy my first steps, and if you’d like to message me, you can find the link at the end of the first page.</p>
